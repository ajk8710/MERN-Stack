// NODE - is a framework to run js on server, also is able to provide everything that 
// we need to build an entertprse level application
// I/O - operations
// db connections
// file manipulations
// creating web servers
// creating http modules
// etc...


// NodeJs - JRE -> whats the difference?

// real time time systems - node js
// 100s of connections linkdin - can share information including text, images, videos, etc
// node(live, light weight servers) base systems - points on various servers to store and serve the information
// majorly it uses flat file structure to save and fetch data
// event loop based high performant single threaded framework

// limitations -
// all the task where calculation is involved


// Service Oriented Architecture
// Backend is termed as API or services and responds with data (json) over RESTFul/https channels
// Fronted is single page, contains logic to generate UI on the fly with the help of server data

// REST => Representational State Transfer Protocol
// API => Application Programming Interface

// REST Specifications =>
// Unique End Point = https://google.map.us/state/locations
// http/s => hyper text type protocol and is stateless
// Representational information, html5 => hyper text markup language

// For example, if I go to one page of Amazon, then move onto the next - it loses previous state
// Everything is fetched and rendered again when you click the back.
// Each page is a representaion / a view

// One api should do one job well
// User - API - should be able to do CRUD operations
// Repective HTTP methods as below:

// Create - POST
// Update - PUT/PATCH
// Delete - Delete
// GetUser - Get
// GetUserByID - Get/ID

// Request <==> Response (handshake)
